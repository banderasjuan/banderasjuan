## Hi there!👋 I'm Juan 👨🏼‍💻

Data Scientist with a passion for turning data into actionable business insights.

🔍 What I Do

I specialize in extracting meaningful patterns from complex datasets and building machine learning solutions that solve real-world problems. My approach combines rigorous statistical analysis with practical business understanding gained from a decade in logistics and transportation.

🛠️ Technical Skills

- Programming: Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Databases: SQL for data extraction and manipulation
- Machine Learning: Supervised/unsupervised learning, model evaluation, feature engineering
- Data Analysis: Statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, A/B testing
- Data Visualization: Creating compelling stories with data through charts and dashboards
- Data Wrangling: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing messy datasets for analysis

💼 What Sets Me Apart

My 10 years in operations, marketing, sales and business development have taught me to ask the right questions and understand what businesses actually need from their data. I don't just build models—I build solutions that drive decisions and create value.

🚀 What You'll Find Here
